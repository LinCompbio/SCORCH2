## Introduction

SCORCH2 (SC2) is a machine learning-based consensus rescoring model designed for interaction-based virtual screening. SC2 is a continual work build upon SC1 (https://github.com/SMVDGroup/SCORCH/), where two XGBoost models are curated with distinct data and trained independently to derive local optimal knowledge patterns. Their outputs are then combined in a consensus manner, resulting in improved active compound enrichment.

## Environment setup 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Dataset
PDBScreen data is derived from [Equiscore](https://github.com/CAODH/EquiScore?tab=readme-ov-file) and can be accessed from: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/8049380).

SCORCH1 data is from https://github.com/SMVDGroup/SCORCH/

PDBBind data is from https://www.pdbbind-plus.org.cn

## Data prep

SC2 accepts the same data curation setting in SC1, including `.pdbqt` format input for receptor and ligand, SC2 officially takes [ADFRsuite](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/downloads/) for format conversion.

Just so you know, SC2 is a rescoring method; the input is hypothesized to be docked poses, and SC2 does not generate the docking poses itself.

üß¨ Ligand Batch Conversion to .pdbqt Format
<pre>
python receptor_2_pdbqt.py \
  --input_dir /path/to/input_ligands \
  --output_dir /path/to/output_pdbqt \
  --input_format mol2 \
  --n_proc XX
</pre>

üß¨ Receptor Batch Conversion to .pdbqt Format
<pre>
python ligand_2_pdbqt.py \
  --input_dir /path/to/input_ligands \
  --output_dir /path/to/output_pdbqt \
  --input_format pdb \
  --n_proc XX
</pre>

PS: Adding charges by Openbabel may cause result deviation.

## Feature extraction

SC2 feature is majorly combined with three parts, BINANA, ECIF, and Rdkit descriptors, to extract features for rescoring. Run the script below:
<pre>
python feature_extraction_ligand_entropy.py --des_path /path/to/results --protein_base_path /path/to/proteins --molecule_path /path/to/molecules
</pre>

PS: The speed for running will depend on the size of the receptor, crop redundant parts will significantly increase the efficiency.

## Normalization

SC2 combines two XGBoost models with separate normalizer, with the feature generated, you will need to scale them into distinct feature spaces.

<pre>
python process_data.py scaling \
    --feature_dir /path/to/features \
    --output_path /path/to/normalized_features \
    --pb_scaler_path /path/to/sc2_pb_scaler \
    --ps_scaler_path /path/to/sc2_ps_scaler
</pre>

The code will create two sub-repositories under --output_path, including the feature for SC2-PS and SC2-PB.

<!--
## Retrain the model 

Though we recommend taking official weights since SC2 has already been explored for optimal generalizability and top enrichment in current scope, but you could run the code below to retrain the model on your own data.

```bash
python train_xgboost.py --train_features <path_to_train_features> \
                        --train_labels <path_to_train_labels> \
                        --test_features <path_to_test_features> \
                        --test_labels <path_to_test_labels> \
                        --output_dir <path_to_output_directory> \
                        [--n_trials <number_of_trials>]
```
-->

## Running

### Reproduce the result on common benchmarks

Download the prepared features (DUD-E, DEKOIS, VSDS-VD, MERCK FEP benchmark), model weight, and normalizers for two XGBoost models from [Zenodo](10.5281/zenodo.14994007). Unzip the files to the root repository. Then run one of the scripts below:

#### DEKOIS 2.0
<pre>
python sc2_evaluation.py vs \
    --sc2_ps /path/to/models/sc2_ps.xgb \
    --sc2_pb /path/to/models/sc2_pb.xgb \
    --sc2_ps_feature_repo /path/to/features/sc2_ps \
    --sc2_pb_feature_repo /path/to/features/sc2_pb \
    --keyword active \
    --aggregate \
    --gpu \
    --output output/vs_results.csv
</pre>

Features from different docking methods are integrated inside and simply change the child path to get SC2 result on other DEKOIS2.0 docking poses, for example:
<pre>
--sc2_ps_feature_repo evaluation_feature/dekois/sc2_ps/sc2_ps_flare --sc2_pb_feature_repo evaluation_feature/dekois/sc2_pb/sc2_pb_flare
</pre>

PS: DUD-E, DEKOIS 2.0 (vina,ledock,surflex,gold) will not support result aggregation since only one pose for each compound is available

#### DUD-E 
<pre>
  --sc2_ps_feature_repo evaluation_feature/dude/sc2_ps_equiscore_dude \
  --sc2_pb_feature_repo evaluation_feature/dude/sc2_pb_equiscore_dude \
  --keyword active
</pre>

#### VSDS-vd
<pre>
  --sc2_ps_feature_repo evaluation_feature/vsds/sc2_ps_flare_vsds \
  --sc2_pb_feature_repo evaluation_feature/vsds/sc2_pb_flare_vsds \
  --aggregate \
  --keyword inactive
</pre>


#### MERCK FEP benchmark
<pre> 
python sc2_evaluation.py ranking \
    --sc2_ps /path/to/models/sc2_ps.xgb \
    --sc2_pb /path/to/models/sc2_pb.xgb \
    --sc2_ps_feature_repo /path/to/features/sc2_ps_normalized \
    --sc2_pb_feature_repo /path/to/features/sc2_pb_normalized \
    --exp_repo /path/to/experimental_data \
    --gpu \
    --output output/ranking_results.csv
</pre>

### Running on private data

You may change the code on `sc2_evaluation.py` and create customized results, and in the future SC2 will be available on the Lab server as a common service to the community.
