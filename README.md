# Introduction

SCORCH2 (SC2) is a consensus docking pose rescoring ML model for interaction-based virtual screening. SC2 is a continual work build upon SC1 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090123222001552?via%3Dihub), where two XGBoost models are curated and trained separately to derive optimal knowledge pattern and then merge their result together for top-tier actives enrichment.
